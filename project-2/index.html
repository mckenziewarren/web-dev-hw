        <p> How to Bake a Vanilla Cake </p>
    </div>

    <div id="ingredients">
      <ul>
        <li> 2 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for the pans </li>
        <li> 3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for the pans </li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon baking powder </li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon salt </li>
        <li> 1 1/4 cups sugar </li>
        <li> 4 large eggs, at room temperature </li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon vanilla extract </li>
        <li> 1 1/4 cups whole milk </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="directions">
      <ol>
        <li> Preheat the oven to 350<sup>o</sup> <abbr title="Fahrenheit">F</abbr>. Butter two 9-inch-round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper; butter the parchment and dust the pans with flour, tapping out the excess. </li>
        <li> Whisk 3 cups flour, the baking powder and salt in a bowl until combined. Beat 2 sticks butter and the sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to medium; beat in the eggs, one at a time, scraping down the bowl as needed. Beat in the vanilla. (The mixture may look separated at this point.) Beat in the flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with the milk, beginning and ending with flour, until just smooth. </li>
        <li> Divide the batter between the prepared pans. Bake until the cakes are lightly golden on top and a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer to racks and let cool 10 minutes, then run a knife around the edge of the pans and turn the cakes out onto the racks to cool completely. Remove the parchment. Trim the tops of the cakes with a long serrated knife to make them level, if desired. </li>
      </ol>
